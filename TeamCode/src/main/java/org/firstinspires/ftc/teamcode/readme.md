# Getting Started
I recommend watching these two videos on the [Scotts Bots Youtube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/@ScottsBots10158): [General Overview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HI7eyLLpCgM) and [Tuning Guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EXX5_KwfVM&t=5s) before start tuning
* To start, open the [pedroPathing folder](https://github.com/BaronClaps/Pedro-Pathing-Quickstart/blob/master/TeamCode/src/main/java/org/firstinspires/ftc/teamcode/config/pedroPathing/)
* From there, continue to the [localizer folder](https://github.com/BaronClaps/Pedro-Pathing-Quickstart/tree/master/TeamCode/src/main/java/org/firstinspires/ftc/teamcode/config/pedroPathing/localization) and follow the steps in the [readme](https://github.com/BaronClaps/Pedro-Pathing-Quickstart/tree/master/TeamCode/src/main/java/org/firstinspires/ftc/teamcode/config/pedroPathing/localization#readme) to setup your localizer.
* After setting up your localizer, continue to follow the [tuning steps](https://github.com/BaronClaps/Pedro-Pathing-Quickstart/blob/master/TeamCode/src/main/java/org/firstinspires/ftc/teamcode/config/pedroPathing/TUNING.md)
* After you have run all the necessary tests, you can move on to creating autos and tele-ops within the [teleop]() and [auto]() folders.
* I have created [examples](https://github.com/BaronClaps/Pedro-Pathing-Quickstart/tree/master/TeamCode/src/main/java/org/firstinspires/ftc/teamcode/opmode/example) for each type, with comments and explanations of most functions used.
